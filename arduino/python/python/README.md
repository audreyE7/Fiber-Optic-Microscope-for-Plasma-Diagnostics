# ðŸ”¬ Fiber-Optic Microscope for Plasma Diagnostics

This project combines **Arduino temperature logging** with **Python-based optical diagnostics** to analyze plasma behavior using fiber-optic sensing and video intensity tracking.

Itâ€™s designed to help visualize plasma stability, heat distribution, and intensity fluctuations using simple, low-cost instruments (Arduino + camera + fiber-optic feed).
